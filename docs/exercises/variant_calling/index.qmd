# Variant calling {#sec-variantcalling}

## Best practice pipeline

Briefly describe best practice pipeline (e.g. GATK, bcftools,
freebayes), highlighting some of the problems with natural
populations:
- many workflows are human-centric and don't scale to non-model
  organisms (e.g. chromosome numbers in GATK)


Workflows begin with mapping; do this as common step. Then, move on to
variant calling and present three alternatives to highlight differences:

1. GATK (human-centric; highlight problems)
2. freebayes
3. ANGSD - especially for low-coverage, however need to work with
   genotype likelihoods

Make 2 and 3 optional.
