# Preparation {#sec-preparation}

::: {.callout-warning}

## FIXME

Student preparatory information, including:

- howto setup compute environment
- howto work on uppmax
- suggested reading

:::

## Compute environment {#sec-preparation-compute-environment}

Add instructions on packages to install, or provide a docker image.

## Command line {#sec-preparation-command-line}

Add basics of working in a CLI. Add list of hints on how to get
information on commands (e.g., -h option or --help option).

Many exercises will be based on command line tools, including bash
functions, awk and sed.

csvtk plots can be piped to `display`.

So as not to interrupt flow of text many explanations of commands have
been put in footnotes?

## UPPMAX {#sec-preparation-uppmax}

Add instructions on how to work on uppmax. Prerecorded video would be
nice.

## Population genetics basics {#sec-preparation-population-genetics-basics}

Add short summary of basic concepts? Glossary-like?

## Suggested readings {#sec-preparation-suggested-readings}

@johri_RecommendationsImprovingStatistical_2022 on recommendations for
improving statistical inference in population genomics.
