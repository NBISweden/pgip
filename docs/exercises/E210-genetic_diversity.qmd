FIXME: pen-and-paper exercise to calculate diversity based on "fixed"
genotype calls and genotype likelihoods to highlight differences; the
latter requires GLs for **all** sites. Use Table 4.1 in
[@hartl1997principles, p.173] and/or Figure 3.1 in
[@hahn_MolecularPopulationGenetics_2019, p. 45]

- use sequence masks (0/1) encoded gz files to enable quick
  calculations of feature-based stats (e.g. 4d-degenerate sites)
