# Data generation

What are the goals? To compile variation data for individuals. What are the issues?

- sampling
- library preparation cost
- sequencing cost
- lack of reference genomes (soon outdated)

## Sequencing protocols

### Individual sequencing

- high-coverage sequencing
  - pros: comprehensive coverage
  - cons: until recently expensive, time-consuming
- low-coverage sequencing @lou_BeginnerGuideLowcoverage_2021
  - pros: cost-efficient, better to sample many sites
  - cons: needs alternative analysis methods (likelihoods)

### pool sequencing

- pool-seq @schlotterer_SequencingPoolsIndividuals_2014
- RADSeq [@davey_RADSeqNextgenerationPopulation_2010; @baird_RapidSNPDiscovery_2008]

## Reference genome

Once individual re-sequencing data has been obtained, it is mapped to
a reference genome. For non-model organisms, reference genomes are
often lacking[^genome-projects], for which reason many studies include
sequencing and genome assembly of a reference individual. In other
cases, a solution is to map to a closely related species. That comes
with issues of its own, such as reads primarily mapping to conserved
regions, thereby biasing population genomic statistics, or structural
rearrangements between species hampering inferences. A final option is
to map reads to a reference transcriptome. However, given the drop in
sequencing cost and advances in long-read technologies, new projects
could be complemented with *de novo* assembly of a reference
individual.

## Low-coverage whole genome sequencing

## Filtering data

cf Table 3 [@lou_BeginnerGuideLowcoverage_2021 p. 5974]

[^genome-projects]: This is likely to change soon as ongoing efforts
 to generate genome assemblies over a large range of taxa, for
 instance [@*GenomeAtlasEuropean*] and
 [@*VertebrateGenomesProject*], are completed.
