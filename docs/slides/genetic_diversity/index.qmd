Outline:

Describe genetic diversity in more detail. Neglected component of
biodiversity. Key feature: code for phenotypic variation -> adaptive
potential. Dawkins: natural selection must have variation to act on.
Low diversity -> low Ne -> 1) more inbreeding 2) nat sel less
efficient 3) loss of functional variants. Plot overview of diversity
in species [@leffler_RevisitingOldRiddle_2012]. Look at historical
descriptions and predictions of diversity? (I'm thinking the
development of the neutral model; see
[@hurst_GeneticsUnderstandingSelection_2009]). Provide plot of
expected heterozygosity under neutral model and compare with observed
data [@romiguier_ComparativePopulationGenomics_2014;
@bergeron_EvolutionGermlineMutation_2023]. Link historical to
contemporary heterozygosity and highlight importance for conservation
[@webstermatthew_GeneticVariationMountain_2022;
@desroches_ConservingIntraspecificVariation_2021;
@willi_ConservationGeneticsManagement_2022]

How to measure? Ne, population structure, inbreeding. Plot Ne for
examples. NGS -> uprecedented detail; better N_e, F_ST, as well as
identification of adaptive loci, introgression, demographic history,
etc. Requires reference genome! N_e can be estimated from Watterson's
theta, but as it represents harmonic mean, it says nothing of recent
declines, which is important for conservations studies. Note in
passing here, and refer to section on demography later on.

[@kimura_1983, p201-202] has a good example of how it is unlikely that
a rapid decrease of population size during last few generations will
lead to significant reduction in heterozygosity.

Genetic diversity is not the only issue for conservation however
[@lewis_BiggestEverStudy_2023]:

>The analysis of all 233 species’ genomes also has implications for
>conservation. For example, it shows that genetic diversity within a
>species does not align with its extinction risk1. That’s surprising,
>says Behie, because lower genetic diversity, which can result from
>inbreeding when population size diminishes, is widely considered a
>sign that a species is at risk of extinction. The finding suggests
>that for some threatened species, populations have declined so fast
>that there hasn’t been time for inbreeding to occur. This points to
>factors other than inbreeding — such as habitat destruction — being
>the greater threat to a species’ resilience.

[@begun_PopulationGenomicsWholeGenome_2007] makes interesting
statements on the study of variation in the population genetics
context:

1. small values of *s* may be detected as deviaton from neutral expectation and
2. enables study of recent (less polymorphism, higher LD) and ancient
   selection (increased divergence between species)

They also summarize very well the motivation for genome-wide studies
and that diversity is shaped by a number of factors, including:

1. variation in mutation rates
2. variation in recombination rates
3. gene density
4. natural selection

Riddle: why is genetic diversity range so narrow? Possibly there are
lower and upper limits.

Lower limit: censoring effect, i.e., when diversity passes a lower
limit, population is driven to extinction due to inability to adapt

Upper limit: functional/structural constraints, e.g., impaired
chromosome pairing or reproductive incompatibilities

Linked selection, that is, variation-reducing selection. Larger
populations have higher influx of new mutations, so if more draft,
higher reduction in diversity. Would require strong frequent levels of
selection; little support for this in literature.

Purifying selection. Nearly neutral model could explain narrow range.

[@ellegren_DeterminantsGeneticDiversity_2016] Upper limit could in
part be explained by linked selection
[@corbett-detig_NaturalSelectionConstrains_2015]

#### Genetic drift

Reduces diversity at loss $\propto \frac{1}{N}$

#### Selection

Adaptive selection decreases selection, more so if acting on new
mutations compared to standing variation.

Balancing selection may increase variation.

#### Recombination

Low recombination rates leads to less "reshuffling" of variation and
hence lower diversity.

Note: lower recombination lowers diversity presumably because more
neutral variants linked to selected sites. There are intriguing
differences between taxa [@leffler_RevisitingOldRiddle_2012]

## On missing data in population genetics

[@korunes_PixyUnbiasedEstimation_2021] Fig 4 on real data: strong
tendency of commonly adopted tools to **underestimate** pi, dxy (even
for 30X data sets)

## Nucleotide diversity revisited

Most textbooks assume full sequence data
[@korunes_PixyUnbiasedEstimation_2021]. Vast majority of tools make
"assumption that missing sites are present but invariant".

Consequence: $\pi$, $d_{XY}$ tend to be downwards biased

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

$$
\pi = \frac{\sum_{i<j}k_{ij}}{n\choose 2} = \frac{c_0c_1}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} = \left( \frac{n}{n-1} \right)2\left( \frac{c_0}{n} \right)\left( \frac{c_1}{n} \right)
$$
