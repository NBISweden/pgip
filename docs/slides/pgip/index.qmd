Points from [@hahn_MolecularPopulationGenetics_2019]:

- whole-genome data instead of single loci - population genomics is
  population genetics for whole-genome sequences
  - if only this, not too exciting
- major promise: enables analyses not possible for single loci or that
  require genomic context
- addresses interactions between different forces, notably selection
  and demographic history

Some applications:

- genome-wide scans for selection
  - selection vs demography
- methods for genome-wide scans
- non-independence
  - different statistics rely on similar input
  - overlapping peaks from different statistics *not* independent

[@hartl1997principles p. 469-470]

[@li_InferenceHumanPopulation_2011, supplementary notes, p. 6]:

"...highly consistent except for the very recent history,
demonstrating the power of using whole-genome data."

[@fuller_PopulationGeneticsCoral_2020] is an example of a population
genomics study that applies methods that could be seen as a basic
foundation of population genomics. We believe these present a minimum
toolkit of methods that should be known to anyone starting out in
population genomics, and that is sufficiently small to be presented in
a one-week workshop. At the end of this lecture, we will discuss some
more advanced applications in population genomics.

Walk through steps of the main figures which represent common analyses
in a population genomics experiment. No need to supply text; better to
exemplify via the figures.

Genome assembly and sampling

Points to consider:

- choice of reference individual
- the number of populations
- the number of samples (more sites better than many samples per
     population)
- the geographical distribution of samples
- sequencing depth (low-coverage often sufficient)

Variation and demographic history

- LD decay: important for imputation (e.g.,
  stephens_AccountingDecayLinkage_2005)
- The extent of LD and its decay with genetic distance are useful
  parameters for determining the number of markers needed to
  successfully map a QTL, and the resolution with which the trait can
  be successfully mapped otyama_EvaluationLinkageDisequilibrium_2019

Little differentiation across reefs -> littel population structure
over hundreds of kilometers. However, there are environmental
differences (thermal regimes). Scan for pi outliers:

- points to *sacsin* gene
- h12 measures the frequency of the two most common haplotypes; red
  indicate 0.01% outlier genome-wide
- 4C: tree for central 1kb region in *sacsin* deeper than split from
  *A.digitifera* and *A.tenuis*
  - variation in *sacsin* has been maintained for long time
  - co-chaperone for heat-shock protein Hsp70

::: {.notes }

Population genetics focuses on the genetic basis of evolution. It is
mainly a theoretical subject, owing to the slow changes of genetic
variation. As such, it tries to explain the shape and structure of
genetic variation from theoretical predictions and models.

::: {.notes }

- from locus-based studies (e.g., alcohol dehydrogenase in Drosophila
  [@kreitman_NucleotidePolymorphismAlcohol_1983]) to genome-wide
  (e.g., Drosophila population genomics
  [@begun_PopulationGenomicsWholeGenome_2007]
- note: studied loci have often not been randomly chosen, which is
  another argument for whole-genome studies
- enabler: sequencing technology

[@fuller_PopulationGeneticsCoral_2020] paper has population genetics
in title -> population genetics is a key ingredient.

Refer to Hahn's points about learning something about global patterns:

- selection acts locally, demography globally
- the structure of genetic variation and how it depends on
  - recombination landscapes and linked selection
  - demographic changes
  - identification of neutral loci

So, not simply about applying 10000 selection tests for multiple loci

Population genetics in title of previous slide => population genomics
is large-scale population genetics? At the very least, shows the
foundational role population genetics plays.

All of the points above point to the importance of statistics which
implies mathematics / computational skills important

## Statistical inference in population genomics

The data deluge requires advanced statistical methods and models to do
inference. Today data production outpaces theoretical advances.
Therefore, take care not to attach too much faith to a test that
explains data well.

::: {.fragment}

A population genomics study should aim at generating a baseline model
that takes into account the processes that shape genetic variation
[@johri_RecommendationsImprovingStatistical_2022]:

1. mutation
2. recombination
3. gene conversion
4. purifying selection acting on functional regions and its effects on
   linked variants (background selection)
5. genetic drift with demographic history and geographic structure
