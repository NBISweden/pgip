As the focus of the course is on hands-on work, the topics have been
designed to cover the fundamental analyses that are common in many
population genomics studies. The course consists of lectures and
exercises, with a focus on the practical aspects of analyses. Whereas
lectures introduce some background theory, their primary aim is to set
the stage for accompanying exercises.

## The manuscript route {#sec-manuscript-route}

In principle, you could imagine the course structure to follow that of
a manuscript [@fuller_PopulationGeneticsCoral_2020]

High-throughput DNA sequencing has now made it possible to generate
whole-genome resequencing data for multiple individuals and
populations, and a first step is to map sequence data to a reference,
perform variant calling and variant filtering.

Once a high-quality variant set has been obtained, a common task is to
describe variation, either in terms of summary statistics such as
nucleotide diversity ($\pi$) or site-frequency spectra (sfs), or as
descriptions of population structure in terms of admixture or pca
plots.

Genetic diversity is also affected by population history and
demographic processes such as population expansion, bottlenecks,
migration events and hybridizations.

Finally, it is often of interest to identify adaptive traits, to which
end selection tests and scans can be performed. The tests are designed
to detect signals of selection, either via direct selection on loci,
or by looking at haplotype structures to detect linked selection.

## The baseline model

Much of what has been described in [The manuscript
 route](#sec-manuscript-route) has recently been treated in an article
on recommendations for improving statistical inference in population
genomics [@johri_RecommendationsImprovingStatistical_2022]. In it,
the authors point out that whereas historically theoretical advances
outpaced data production, that is no longer true due to the advent of
next-generation sequencing. In particular, they caution researchers
to attach too much faith to a test that explains the data well, as
there are many alternative hypotheses with equal explanatory power,
but with drastically different conclusions. At the very least, a
population genomics study should aim at first generating a baseline
model consisting of all or several of the following components:

1. mutation
2. recombination
3. gene conversion
4. purifying selection acting on functional regions and its effects on
   linked variants (background selection)
5. genetic drift with demographic history and geographic structure

The exercises are designed to address many of the points above, and to
highlight cases where competing hypotheses may actually explain data
to equal degrees.
