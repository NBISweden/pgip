In the ARG, by convention the sequence to the left of the breakpoint takes the left path, the sequence to the right the right path.\nThe end consequence of recombination is that the chromosome/sequence will consist of non-recombining units with different genealogical histories.

Stankowski et al. (2019) et al use simulations (SLiM and msprime) to shed light on processes that shape genomic landscapes, which are correlated between species.\n\nWe will look more closely at this system tomorrow.\n\n\nSimulations are based on variations of a neutral base model that starts out with an ancestral population (N=10,000) that after 10N generation splits to two daughter populations (N=10,000 each) and are simulated another 10N generations. The chromosome is 21Mbp (similar in size to a monkeyflower chromosome) consisting of a central neutrally evolving region flanked by two regions where non-neutral processes are “allowed”. Models are:\n\nneutral\nBGS (non-neutral mutations are deleterious)\nBateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility (BDMI); after split, fraction variants deleterious in one population, neutral in other\npositive selection\nBGS and positive selection\nlocal adaptation; 4 but also after split some variants beneficial in one population, neutral in other\n\nFigure caption:\n\nFig 7.

The gray boxes in the first column show the areas of the chromosome that are experiencing selection, while the white central area evolves neutrally. Note that π (in populations a and b) and dxy have been mean centered so they can be viewed on the same scale.

    "text": "Background\nRegardless of how a raw variant call set has been produced, the calls will be of varying quality for a number of reasons. For high-coverage sequencing, the two most common are incompleteness of the reference sequence and misaligmnents in repetitive regions (Li, 2014). Low-coverage sequencing comes with its own biases and issues, with the most important being the difficulty to accurately call genotypes do to the low coverage, which in practice leads to an underrepresentation of heterozygote calls.\nTo improve the accuracy of downstream inference, a number of analysis-dependent quality control filters can be applied to the raw variant call set (for a concise summary, see Lou et al. (2021)). In this exercise, we will focus on coverage-based filters, with the aim of generating sequence masks to denote regions of a reference sequence that contain sufficient information across individuals and populations. Furthermore, the masks will be applied in the context of genetic diversity calculations, in which case specific filters on polymorphic sites (e.g., p-value or minimum minor allele frequency (MAF)) should not be applied (all sites contain information).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Coverage distributions for three hypothetical samples along with the cumulative coverage for all samples.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the sequencing coverage of three samples. The important thing to note is that the coverage is uneven. Some regions lack coverage entirely, e.g., due to random sampling or errors in the reference sequence. Other regions have excessive coverage, which could be a sign of repeats that have been collapsed in the reference. A general coverage filter could then seek to mask out sites where a fraction (50%, say) of individuals have too low or excessive coverage.\nThe right panel illustrates the sum of coverages across all samples. Minimum and maximum depth filters could be applied to the aggregate coverages of all samples, or samples grouped by population, to eliminate sites confounding data support.\nThe vcf we have produced contains all sites; that is, both monomorphic and polymorphic sites are present. Every site contains information about depth and other metadata, which makes it possible to apply coverage filters directly to the variant file itself. We will make use of direct filters in the first session below (Section 2).\nHowever, it may not always be possible to generate a vcf with all sites. Species with large genomes will produce files so large that they prevent efficient downstream processing. Under these circumstances, ad hoc coverage filters can be applied to the bam files to in turn generate sequence masks that can be used in conjunction with the variant file. This is the topic for the second session (Section 3)."

    "text": "Advanced filtering based coverage analyses\nMapped reads provide information about how well a given genomic region has been represented during sequencing, and this information is usually summarized as the sequencing coverage. For any locus, this is equivalent to the number of reads mapping to that locus.\nSequencing coverage is typically not uniformly distributed over the reference. Reasons may vary but include uneven mapping coverage due to repeat regions, low coverage due to mis-assemblies, or coverage biases generated in the sequencing process. Importantly, both variable and monomorphic sites must be treated identically in the filtering process to eliminate biases between the two kinds of sites.\nIn this part, we will use mosdepth and bedtools to quickly generate depth of coverage profiles of mapped data. mosdepth is an ultra-fast command line tool for calculating coverage from a bam file. By default, it generates a summary of the global distribution, and per-base coverage in bed.gz format. We will be using the per-base coverage for filtering.\nAlternatively, mosdepth can also output results in a highly compressed format d4, which has been developed to handle the ever increasing size of resequencing projects. Files in d4 format can be processed with the d4-tools tool (Hou et al., 2021). For instance, d4tools view will display the coverage in bed format. We mention this in passing as it may be relevant when working with large genomes or sample sizes, but given the size of our sample data, we will be using bedtools from now on.\nPer sample coverage\nWe start by calculating per-sample coverages with mosdepth. For downstream purposes, we need to save the size of the chromosomes we’re looking at, and for many applications, a fasta index file is sufficient.\n\nexport REF=M_aurantiacus_v1.fasta\nsamtools faidx ${REF}\n\n[E::fai_build3_core] Failed to open the file M_aurantiacus_v1.fasta\n[faidx] Could not build fai index M_aurantiacus_v1.fasta.fai\n\n\nThe syntax to generate coverage information for a bam file is mosdepth &lt;prefix&gt; &lt;input file&gt;. Here, we add the -Q option to exclude reads with a mapping quality less than 20:\n\nmosdepth -Q 20 INJ INJ.sort.dup.recal.bam\n\n[E::hts_open_format] Failed to open file \"INJ.sort.dup.recal.bam\" : No such file or directory\n[hts-nim] could not open 'INJ.sort.dup.recal.bam'.

Experiment changing the window size (-w) parameter to change smoothing.\n\nApparently there are some high-coverage regions that could be associated with, e.g., collapsed repeat regions in the assembly. Let’s compile coverage results for all samples, using bash string manipulation to generate file prefix2\n\nfor f in [A-Z]*.sort.dup.recal.bam; do\n  prefix=${f%.sort.dup.recal.bam}\n  mosdepth -Q 20 $prefix $f\n  echo -e -n \"$prefix\\t\"\n  cat $prefix.mosdepth.summary.txt | grep total\ndone &gt; ALL.mosdepth.summary.txt\ncat ALL.mosdepth.summary.txt\n\n[E::hts_open_format] Failed to open file \"[A-Z]*.sort.dup.recal.bam\" : No such file or directory\n[hts-nim] could not open '[A-Z]*.sort.dup.recal.bam'. No such file or directory\nSIGSEGV: Illegal storage access. (Attempt to read from nil?)\n[A-Z]*  \n\n\nWe can calculate the total coverage with csvtk as follows:\n\ncsvtk summary -H -t ALL.mosdepth.summary.txt -f 5:sum\n\nto get the total coverage 0, which gives a hint at where the diploid coverage peak should be.\nSample set coverages\nWe can combine coverage intervals with bedtools unionbedg. We collect the bed file names and generate matching sample names to pass as arguments to option -names. Also, we include positions with no coverage (-empty) which requires the use of a genome file (option -g). The bed output is piped to bgzip which compresses the output, before finally indexing with tabix:\n\n\nSAMPLES=$(cat sampleinfo.csv | csvtk grep -r -p .*red.* -r -p .*yellow.* -f Taxon | csvtk cut -f Sample | grep -v Sample | tr \"\\n\" \" \")\nBEDGZ=$(for sm in $SAMPLES; do echo -e -n \"${sm}.per-base.bed.gz \"; done)\nbedtools unionbedg -header -names $SAMPLES -g ${REF}.fai -empty -i $BEDGZ | bgzip &gt; ALL.bg.gz\ntabix -f -p bed -S 1 ALL.bg.gz\n\ncat: sampleinfo.csv: No such file or directory\n[33m[WARN][0m csvtk grep: skipping empty input file: -\n[33m[WARN][0m csvtk cut: skipping empty input file: -\nError: missing BedGraph file names (-i) to combine.\n\n\n\nWe also need to combine coverages per populations yellow and red.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the previous command as a template, try to generate per population coverage files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor pop in red yellow; do\n SAMPLES=$(cat sampleinfo.csv | csvtk grep -r -p .*${pop}.* -f Taxon | csvtk cut -f Sample | grep -v Sample | tr \"\\n\" \" \")\n BEDGZ=$(for sm in $SAMPLES; do echo -e -n \"${sm}.per-base.bed.gz \"; done)\n bedtools unionbedg -header -names $SAMPLES -g ${REF} -empty -i $BEDGZ | bgzip &gt; $pop.bed.gz\n tabix -f -p bed -S 1 $pop.bed.gz\ndone\n\ncat: sampleinfo.csv: No such file or directory\n[33m[WARN][0m csvtk grep: skipping empty input file: -\n[33m[WARN][0m csvtk cut: skipping empty input file: -\nError: missing BedGraph file names (-i) to combine.\ncat: sampleinfo.csv: No such file or directory\n[33m[WARN][0m csvtk grep: skipping empty input file: -\n[33m[WARN][0m csvtk cut: skipping empty input file: -\nError: missing BedGraph file names (-i) to combine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal coverage\nSince we eventually want to filter on total coverage, we sum per sample coverages for each sample set with awk:\n\n\nbgzip -c -d ALL.bg.gz | awk -v FS=\"\\t\" -v OFS=\"\\t\" 'NR &gt; 1 {sum=0; for (i=4; i&lt;=NF; i++) sum+=$i; print $1, $2, $3, sum}' | bgzip &gt; ALL.sum.bed.gz\ntabix -f -p bed ALL.sum.bed.gz\n\n\nFor illustration, we plot the total coverage:\n\n\nbedtools intersect -a &lt;(bedtools makewindows -g ${REF}.fai -w 1000) \\\n    -b ALL.sum.bed.gz -wa -wb | \\\n  bedtools groupby -i - -g 1,2,3 -c 7 -o mean | \\\n  csvtk plot -t line -x 2 -y 4 --point-size 0.01 --xlab Position \\\n    --ylab Coverage --width 9.0 --height 3.5 &gt; fig-plot-total-coverage.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Total coverage in 1kb windows.\n\nIn order to define thresholds for subsequent filtering, we plot the proportion of the genome coverage versus depth of coverage (similar to k-mer plots in sequence assembly projects). In\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Genome coverage\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Cumulative genome coverage\n\n\nFigure 4: Genome coverage vs depth of coverage.\n\n\n\nIn Figure 4 a, a diploid peak is evident just below coverage X=150; we zoom in on that region to get a better view:\n\ncat ALL.sum.bed.csv | \\\n  csvtk plot line -x 1 -y 2 --point-size 0.01 \\\n    --xlab \"Depth of coverage (X)\" --ylab \"Genome coverage (kbp)\" \\\n    --width 9.0 --height 3.5 --x-min 90 --x-max 160\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Genome coverage\n\nFigure 5: Genome coverage vs depth of coverage.\n\n\n(Lou et al., 2021) point out that appropriate thresholds depend on the data set, but as a general rule recommends a minimum depth threshold at &lt;0.8x average coverage, and a maximum depth threshold at mean coverage plus one or two standard deviations. Given the unrealistically homogenous coverage of our simulated data, we set thresholds based on Figure 5 to e.g., 100-160.\nWe then use these thresholds to generate a bed file containing regions that are accessible, i.e., have sufficient coverage for downstream analyses. We also calculate the number of bases that pass the filtering criteria.\n\n\nzcat ALL.sum.bed.gz | awk '{if (($4 &gt;= 100) && ($4 &lt;= 160)) print $0}' &gt; ALL.sum.depth.bed.gz\nbedtools genomecov -i ALL.sum.depth.bed.gz -g ${REF}.fai  | grep genome\n\n\nConsequently, 10% of the genome is accessible by depth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nGenerate coverage sums for sample sets CEU, CHB, and YRI, and from these determine coverage thresholds and apply the thresholds to generate bed files with accessible regions.\n\n\nCodefor pop in red yellow; do\n  bgzip -c -d $pop.bed.gz | \\\n    awk -v FS=\"\\t\" -v OFS=\"\\t\" 'NR &gt; 1 {sum=0; for (i=4; i&lt;=NF; i++) sum+=$i; print $1, $2, $3, sum}' | \\\n    bgzip &gt; $pop.sum.bed.gz\n  tabix -f -p bed $pop.sum.bed.gz\n  zcat $pop.sum.bed.gz | \\\n    awk -v h=0 'BEGIN {OFS=\",\"; cumsum=0} {a[$4] += ($3-$2)/1000; if ($4 &gt; h) {h=$4}} END{for (i=0; i&lt;=h; i++) {if (a[i]) {cumsum+=a[i]} else {a[i]=0;} print i, a[i], cumsum}}' \\\n    &gt; $pop.sum.bed.csv\ndone\n\n\n\n\nCodefor pop in red yellow; do\ncat ${pop}.sum.bed.csv | \\\n  csvtk plot line -x 1 -y 2 --point-size 0.01 \\\n    --xlab \"Depth of coverage (X)\" --ylab \"Genome coverage (kbp)\" \\\n    --width 9.0 --height 3.5 --x-min 10 --x-max 100 &gt; \\\n    fig-plot-total-coverage-distribution-hist-zoom-in-$pop.png\ndone\n\ncat: red.sum.bed.csv: No such file or directory\n[31m[ERRO][0m xopen: no content\ncat: yellow.sum.bed.csv: No such file or directory\n[31m[ERRO][0m xopen: no content\n\n\n\n\nNow we have combined total per sample coverage for ALL samples, and for sample sets CEU, CHB, and YRI. The upcoming task will be to generate sequence masks from the total coverage and minimum number of individuals with coverage greater than zero.\nFilter on minimum number of individuals\nIn addition to filtering on coverage, we will also filter on the minimum number of individuals with calls. This is to account for cases where coverages that pass the coverage filter originate from just a few samples. Here, we will remove sites where less than 50% of individuals have a call.\n\n\nbgzip -c -d ALL.bg.gz | \\\n  awk -v FS=\"\\t\" 'BEGIN {OFS=\"\\t\"} NR &gt; 1 {count=0; for (i=4; i&lt;=NF; i++) {if ($i&gt;0) count+=1}; if (count&gt;=((NF-3)*0.5)) {print $1, $2, $3}}' | \\\n  bgzip &gt; ALL.ind.bed.gz\ntabix -f -p bed ALL.ind.bed.gz\n\n\nExercise\nGenerate coverage sums for sample sets CEU, CHB, and YRI.\n\n\nCodefor pop in CEU CHB YRI; do\n  bgzip -c -d $pop.bed.gz | awk -v FS=\"\\t\" 'BEGIN {OFS=\"\\t\"} NR &gt; 1 {count=0; for (i=4; i&lt;=NF; i++) {if ($i&gt;0) count+=1}; if (count&gt;=((NF-3)*0.5)) {print $1, $2, $3}}' | bgzip &gt; $pop.ind.bed.gz\n  tabix -f -p bed $pop.ind.bed.gz\ndone"

The landscapes were highly similar across taxa, and local variation in genomic features, such as gene density and recombination rate, was predictive of variation in landscape patterns. These features suggest the influence of selection, in particular BGS.\nAlthough many characteristics were predicted by a model where BGS is one of the main causes, there were deviations. Therefore, the authors performed simulations in SLiM (Haller & Messer, 2019) with alternative models to see whether other factors could explain the observed patterns.\nIn all, six scenarios were studied:\n\nneutral evolution\nBGS (non-neutral mutations are deleterious)\nBateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility (BDMI); after split, a fraction variants deleterious in one population, neutral in other\npositive selection\nBGS and positive selection\nlocal adaptation; as 4 but also after split some variants are beneficial in one population, neutral in other\n\nFigure 3 shows typical results of the simulations.\n\n\nFigure 3: Genomic landscapes simulated under different divergence histories.\n\nIn conclusion, the authors found that although BGS plays a role, it does not sufficiently explain all observations, and that other aspects of natural selection (such as rapid adaptation) are responsible for the similarities between genomic landscapes.\nA locus that previously had been associated with differentiation of red and yellow ecotypes was investigated in more detail. We will be using this region, located on linkage group 4 (LG4:11,000,000-14,000,000), in the exercises."

The tests are designed to detect signals of selection, either via direct selection on loci, or by looking at haplotype structures to detect linked selection."

    "text": "The baseline model\nMuch of what has been described in The manuscript route has recently been treated in an article on recommendations for improving statistical inference in population genomics (Johri et al., 2022). In it, the authors point out that whereas historically theoretical advances outpaced data production, that is no longer true due to the advent of next-generation sequencing. In particular, they caution researchers to attach too much faith to a test that explains the data well, as there are many alternative hypotheses with equal explanatory power, but with drastically different conclusions. At the very least, a population genomics study should aim at first generating a baseline model consisting of all or several of the following components:\n\nmutation\nrecombination\ngene conversion\npurifying selection acting on functional regions and its effects on linked variants (background selection)\ngenetic drift with demographic history and geographic structure\n\nThe exercises are designed to address many of the points above, and to highlight cases where competing hypotheses may actually explain data to equal degrees."

    "section": "Variant calling overview",
    "text": "Variant calling overview\nA generic variant calling workflow consists of the following basic steps:\n\nread quality control and filtering\nread mapping\nremoval / marking of duplicate reads\njoint / sample-based variant calling\n\nThere are different tweaks and additions to each of these steps, depending on application and method.\nRead quality control\n\n\n\n \nFigure 1: Fastqc per base quality scores, read 1 (upper) and read 2 (lower panel).\n\nDNA sequencers score the quality of each sequenced base as phred quality scores, which is equivalent to the probability \\(P\\) that the call is incorrect. The base quality scores, denoted \\(Q\\), are defined as\n\\[\nQ = -10 \\log_{10} P\n\\]\nHence, a base quality score \\(Q=20\\) corresponds to a 1% probability that the call is incorrect. The base qualities typically drop towards the end of the reads (Figure 1). Prior to mapping it may therefore be prudent to remove reads that display too high drop in quality, too low mean quality, or on some other quality metric reported by the qc software.\nThe quality scores are encoded using ASCII codes. An example of a fastq sequence is given below. The code snippet shows an example of shell commands1 that are separated by a so-called pipe (|) character which takes the output from one process and sends it as input to the next2.\n\nzcat PUN-Y-INJ_R1.fastq.gz | head -n 4 | cut -c -30\n\ngzip: PUN-Y-INJ_R1.fastq.gz: No such file or directory\n\n\nA fastq entry consists of four lines:\n\nsequence id (prefixed by @)\nDNA sequence\nseparator (+)\nphred base quality scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Use the command wc to determine how many sequences are in PUN-Y-INJ_R1.fastq.gz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nzcat PUN-Y-INJ_R1.fastq.gz | wc -l\n\nSince there are four lines per sequence (id, sequence, + separator, qualities) you need to divide the final number by four (622744 / 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead mapping\nRead mapping consists of aligning sequence reads, typically from individuals in a population (a.k.a. resequencing) to a reference sequence. The choice of read mapper depends, partly on preference, but mostly on the sequencing read length and application. For short reads, a common choice is bwa-mem, and for longer reads minimap2.\nIn what follows, we will assume that the sequencing protocol generates paired-end short reads (e.g., from Illumina). In practice, this means a DNA fragment has been sequence from both ends, where fragment sizes have been selected such that reads do not overlap (i.e., there is unsequenced DNA between the reads of a given insert size).\nThe final output of read mapping is an alignment file in binary alignment map (bam) format or variants thereof.\nRemoval / marking of duplicate reads\nDuring sample preparation or DNA amplification with PCR, it may happen that a single DNA fragment is present in multiple copies and therefore produces redundant sequencing reads. This shows up as alignments with identical start and stop coordinates. These so-called duplicate reads should be marked prior to any downstream analyses. The most commonly used tools for this purpose are samtools markdup and picard MarkDuplicates.\nVariant calling\nOnce bam files have been produced, it is time for variant calling. There are many different variant callers, of which we will mention four.\nbcftools is a toolkit to process variant call files, but also has a variant caller command. We will use bcftools to look at and summarize the variant files.\nfreebayes uses a Bayesian model to call variants. It may be very time-consuming in high-coverage regions, and one therefore may have to mask repetitive and other low-complexity regions.\nANGSD is optimized for low-coverage data. Genotypes aren’t called directly; rather, genotype likelihoods form the basis for all downstream analyses, such as calculation of diversity or other statistics.\nFinally, GATK HaplotypeCaller performs local realignment around variant candidates, which avoids the need to run the legacy GATK IndelRealigner. Realignment improves results but requires more time to run. GATK is optimized for human data. For instance, performance drops dramatically if the reference sequence consists of many short scaffolds/contigs, and there is a size limit to how large the chromosomes can be. It also requires some parameter optimization and has a fairly complicated workflow (Hansen, 2016).\nGATK best practice variant calling\nWe will base our work on the GATK Germline short variant discovery workflow. In addition to the steps outlined above, there is a step where quality scores are recalibrated in an attempt to correct errors produced by the base calling procedure itself.\nGATK comes with a large set of tools. For a complete list and documentation, see the “Tool Documentation Index” (2023)."

    "section": "Read mapping",
    "text": "Read mapping\nWe will start by mapping fastq read pairs to the reference. We will use the bwa read mapper together with samtools to process the resulting output.\nRead group information identifies sequence sets\nSome of the downstream processes require that reads have been assigned read groups (“Read Groups,” 2023), which is a compact string representation of a set of reads that originate from a sequencing unit and sample. Assigning read groups becomes particularly important for multiplexing protocols, or when a sample has been sequenced on different lanes or platform units, as it allows for the identification of sequence batch issues (e.g., poor sequencing quality). Here, we want to assign a unique ID, the sample id (SM), and the sequencing platform (PL), where the latter informs the algorithms on what error model to apply. The read group is formatted as @RG\\tID:uniqueid\\tSM:sampleid\\tPU:platform, where \\t is the tab character. More fields can be added; see the SAM specification, section 1.3 (HTS Format Specifications, 2023) for a complete list.\nSample information is available in the sampleinfo.csv file:\n\nhead -n 3 sampleinfo.csv\n\nhead: cannot open 'sampleinfo.csv' for reading: No such file or directory\n\n\nThe sample information is a combination of the run information obtained from the SRA (BioProject PRJNA549183) and the sample sheet provided with the article. An additional column SampleAlias has been added that names samples using a three-letter abbreviation for population hyphenated with the sample identifier. For the ssp. puniceus, an additional one-letter character denoting the color ecotype is inserted between population and sample id. PUN-Y-BCRD then is a sample from the puniceus subspecies with the yellow ecotype. We will use the Run column as unique ID, SampleAlias as the sample id SM, and ILLUMINA as the platform PL.\nRead mapping with bwa and conversion to bam format with samtools\nLet’s map the fastq files corresponding to sample PUN-Y-BCRD:\n\nbwa mem -R \"@RG\\tID:SRR9309788\\tSM:PUN-Y-BCRD\\tPL:ILLUMINA\" -t 4 \\\n -M M_aurantiacus_v1.fasta PUN-Y-BCRD_R1.fastq.gz PUN-Y-BCRD_R2.fastq.gz | \\\n samtools sort - | samtools view -h -o PUN-Y-BCRD.sort.bam\n\nThere’s a lot to unpack here. First, the -R flag to bwa mem passes the read group information to the mapper. -t sets the number of threads, and -M marks shorter split hits as secondary, which is for Picard compatibility3. The first positional argument is the reference sequence, followed by the fastq files for read 1 and 2, respectively.\nThe output would be printed on the screen (try running the bwa mem command alone!), but we pipe the output to samtools sort to sort the mappings (by default by coordinate). The - simply means “read from the pipe”.\nFinally, samtools view converts the text output to binary format (default), including the header information (option -h). You can use the same command to view the resulting output on your screen:\n\nsamtools view PUN-Y-BCRD.sort.bam | head -n 2\n\n[E::hts_open_format] Failed to open file \"PUN-Y-BCRD.sort.bam\" : No such file or directory\nsamtools view: failed to open \"PUN-Y-BCRD.sort.bam\" for reading: No such file or directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the header information of the output bam file. What does the @SQ tag stand for, and what does the information on that line tell you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get a list of options, type samtools view. The -H option views the header only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsamtools view -H PUN-Y-BCRD.sort.bam\n\n[E::hts_open_format] Failed to open file \"PUN-Y-BCRD.sort.bam\" : No such file or directory\nsamtools view: failed to open \"PUN-Y-BCRD.sort.bam\" for reading: No such file or directory\n\n\nAlthough you can probably figure it out by looking at the data, do have a glance at the SAM format specification mentioned above. The @SQ tag corresponds to the reference sequence dictionary and tells you what region you are looking at (chromosome LG4, which has a length LN 100000 bases; the example reference sequence was created by extracting the region on LG4 from position 12000000 to 12100000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping from uBAM file\nThere is an alternative storage format for the fastq files called uBAM (unmapped BAM format). The GATK developers promote its use in lieu of fastq files since BAM files can store more metadata associated with sequencing runs. The workflow is slightly more complex, but the files have been prepared for you so you don’t need to worry about generating the uBAM files.\nTo facilitate downstream processing, we will from now on make use of environment variables4 to refer to a sample and the reference sequence. Retrieve the SRR id from the sampleinfo file.\n\nexport SRR=SRR9309790\nexport SAMPLE=PUN-Y-INJ\nexport REF=M_aurantiacus_v1.fasta\nsamtools fastq ${SAMPLE}.unmapped.bam | \\\n bwa mem -R \"@RG\\tID:${SRR}\\tSM:${SAMPLE}\\tPL:ILLUMINA\" -t 4 -p -M ${REF} - | \\\n samtools sort - | samtools view -h -o ${SAMPLE}.sort.bam\n\nNote that we here need to use the command samtools fastq to read the contents of ${SAMPLE}.unmapped.bam and pipe the output to bwa mem.\nMark duplicate reads with Picard MarkDuplicates\nOnce mapping is completed, we must find and mark duplicate reads as these can distort the results of downstream analyses, such as variant calling. We here use Picard MarkDuplicates5:\n\npicard MarkDuplicates --INPUT ${SAMPLE}.sort.bam \\\n    --METRICS_FILE ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup_metrics.txt \\\n    --OUTPUT ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup.bam\n\nThe metrics output file contains information on the rate of duplication. We will include the output in the final multiqc report.\nGenerate high quality known sites for BQSR\nOnce we have a duplicate marked bam file, we can proceed with Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR). The purpose here is to correct any systematic errors made by the sequencing machine. This is done by applying a machine learning model. Before we do so, however, we need to generate a list of known sites that should not be recalibrated6 Therefore, we will first perform a preliminary round of variant calling and filtering to generate a known sites callset.\n\ngatk HaplotypeCaller -OVI true \\\n  --emit-ref-confidence GVCF \\\n  --annotation FisherStrand -A QualByDepth -A MappingQuality -G StandardAnnotation \\\n  --input ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup.bam --output ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup.raw.hc.g.vcf.gz \\\n  --reference ${REF}\ngatk VariantFiltration -OVI true \\\n  --variant ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup.raw.hc.g.vcf.gz \\\n  --output ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup.raw.hc.filtered.g.vcf.gz \\\n     --filter-name FisherStrand --filter 'FS &gt; 50.0' \\\n  --filter-name QualByDepth --filter 'QD &lt; 4.0' \\\n  --filter-name MappingQuality --filter 'MQ &lt; 50.0'\n\nHaplotypeCaller is GATK’s variant caller that calls both SNPs and indels by realigning sequences in the vicinity of sites that harbor variation. We apply the -ERC option to generate GVCF output format, a condensed VCF format that includes non-variant sites as well as variant sites. The --annotation (-A) option adds annotations to the output that are used in the subsequent filtering step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What does the -OVI parameter do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEither go to the HaplotypeCaller documentation page or type7\n\ngatk HaplotypeCaller --help 2&gt;&1 | less\n\nand look for -OVI. This option is shorthand for --create-output-variant-index and makes HaplotypeCaller create a VCF index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariantFiltration does what its name suggests. The --filter-name / --filter option pairs apply named filters to the input data. For instance, we here remove variants whose mapping quality is below 50.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to the Tool Documentation Index and look up the documentation for the FisherStrand and QualByDepth variant annotations. What do they do and why do you think the filters are applied as they are?\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have per-sample known sites callsets that can be used as input to BQSR.\nBase quality score recalibration\nBase quality score recalibration consists of two commands:\n\ngatk BaseRecalibrator -I ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup.bam \\\n  -R ${REF} --known-sites ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup.raw.hc.filtered.g.vcf.gz \\\n  -O ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup.recal.table\ngatk ApplyBQSR -bqsr ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup.recal.table \\\n  -I ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup.bam -O ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup.recal.bam\n\nBaseRecalibrator compiles empirical data for all non-variant sites for an input bam file for a number of covariates (e.g., nucleotide context). The basic idea is to fit a probability of error (i.e., a quality score of sorts), to observed covariate combinations, which is recorded in a recalibration table file. The probability is then used correct the quality scores reported by the sequencing machine in ApplyBQSR.\nOPTIONAL: Examine the output of BQSR\nWe can investigate how well BQSR has performed by applying two more commands. First, we generate a calibration table for the recalibrated bam file:\n\ngatk BaseRecalibrator -I ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup.recal.bam \\\n  -R ${REF} --known-sites ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup.raw.hc.filtered.g.vcf.gz \\\n  -O ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup.recal.after.table\n\nThen we use the two calibration tables as input to AnalyzeCovariates to generate a pdf output (and a csv file that we will use in the next code block):\n\ngatk AnalyzeCovariates -before ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup.recal.table \\\n  -after ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup.recal.after.table \\\n  -plots ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup.recal.after.pdf \\\n  -csv ${SAMPLE}.sort.dup.recal.after.csv\n\n?@fig-bqsr-analyze-covariates-plot shows an example plot of quality values for base substitutions. There are more plots and summaries in the pdf output file.\n\n\n\nError in file(file, \"rt\"): cannot open the connection\n\n\nError in subset.default(data, EventType == \"Base Substitution\" & CovariateName == : object 'EventType' not found\n\nSeveral rounds of generating known sites followed by BQSR can be applied until convergence. This means that running BQSR can be time-consuming, and one side effect is that the resulting bam output files can become very large, which may or not be a problem. Also, sequencing technologies keep improving, potentially eliminating concerns of biased quality scores. This begs the question: is it worth running BQSR? For the time being, the GATK developers do recommend that BQSR always be run. Keep in mind though, that for non-model organisms, one issue is that there seldom is a catalogue of known sites, which means the user has to bootstrap such a call set, like we did above. For a more complete discussion, see the technical documentation on BQSR."

We once again run GATK HaplotypeCaller and VariantFiltration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the code in section Generate high quality known sites for BQSR as a template, run GATK HaplotypeCaller on the recalibrated bam file, followed by VariantFiltration.

Now we need to combine the samples and perform genotyping. To do so, we need to run the same commands, from mapping to variant calling and filtering on recalibrated files, for all samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf time permits, run the workflow on some more samples (e.g., PUN-R-ELF).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThere are prepared gVCF files for download so there’s no need to run the workflow on all samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompile QC metrics\nIdentifying sample quality issues is crucial for downstream processing. Quality metrics that indicate problems with a sample could potentially lead to its removal entirely from subsequent analyses. Many programs generate QC metrics, but as it is difficult to get an overview by sifting through all separate QC reports, it is recommended that you compile them with MultiQC. Running MultiQC is as simple as\n\nmultiqc .\n\nOpen the report multiqc_report.html to quickly QC your data. There are lots of ways you can interactively modify the report to make more logical groupings (e.g., grouping reports by sample8) , but we won’t go into this topic in more detail here.\nCombine genomic VCF files and genotype\nWe are now at the stage where we can do genotyping of our samples. This done by first combining individual sample gVCF files with GATK CombineGVCFs, followed by genotyping with GenotypeGVCFs.\n\ngatk CombineGVCFs -OVI true --output combine.subset.g.vcf.gz --reference ${REF} \\\n  -V PUN-Y-INJ.sort.dup.recal.hc.g.vcf.gz \\\n  -V PUN-R-ELF.sort.dup.recal.hc.g.vcf.gz\ngatk GenotypeGVCFs -OVI true -R ${REF} -V combine.subset.g.vcf.gz \\\n  -O allsites.subset.vcf.gz --all-sites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a variant call set allsites.vcf.gz but for all the red and yellow samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to specify all gVCF input files via the --variants (-V) option. To get the sample names, look at the first column of sampleinfo.csv:\n\ncat sampleinfo.csv | grep yellow | cut -f 1 -d \",\"\n\ncat: sampleinfo.csv: No such file or directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngatk CombineGVCFs -OVI true --output combine.subset.g.vcf.gz --reference ${REF} \\\n     -V PUN-R-ELF.sort.dup.recal.hc.g.vcf.gz \\\n     -V PUN-R-JMC.sort.dup.recal.hc.g.vcf.gz \\\n     -V PUN-R-LH.sort.dup.recal.hc.g.vcf.gz \\\n     -V PUN-R-MT.sort.dup.recal.hc.g.vcf.gz \\\n     -V PUN-R-UCSD.sort.dup.recal.hc.g.vcf.gz \\\n     -V PUN-Y-BCRD.sort.dup.recal.hc.g.vcf.gz \\\n     -V PUN-Y-INJ.sort.dup.recal.hc.g.vcf.gz \\\n     -V PUN-Y-LO.sort.dup.recal.hc.g.vcf.gz \\\n     -V PUN-Y-PCT.sort.dup.recal.hc.g.vcf.gz \\\n     -V PUN-Y-POTR.sort.dup.recal.hc.g.vcf.gz\ngatk GenotypeGVCFs -OVI true -R ${REF} -V combine.g.vcf.gz \\\n  -O allsites.vcf.gz --all-sites"

For instance, SN corresponds to Summary numbers:\n\ngrep \"^SN\" allsites.vcf.gz.stats\n\nHere, we can see that we have included non-variant sites (no-ALTs), that there are indels, and that a number of sites are multiallelic (more than two alleles).\nRerunning MultiQC will automatically add this report.\n\n# Use -f to overwrite old report\nmultiqc -f .\n\nWe will use bcftools stats in the next exercise to look more closely at variant quality metrics.\nLooking inside the VCF\nA Variant Call Format (VCF) file consists of three sections: meta-information lines (prefixed with ##), a header line (prefixed with #), followed by the data. The meta-information contains provenance information detailing how the file was generated, FILTER specification, INFO fields that provide additional information to genotypes, FORMAT specification fields that define genotype entries, and more. You can print the header with the command bcftools view -h. An example of each is given below:\n\nbcftools view -h allsites.vcf.gz | grep FILTER | head -n 1\nbcftools view -h allsites.vcf.gz | grep INFO | head -n 1\nbcftools view -h allsites.vcf.gz | grep FORMAT | head -n 1\n\n[E::hts_open_format] Failed to open file \"allsites.vcf.gz\" : No such file or directory\nFailed to read from allsites.vcf.gz: No such file or directory\n[E::hts_open_format] Failed to open file \"allsites.vcf.gz\" : No such file or directory\nFailed to read from allsites.vcf.gz: No such file or directory\n[E::hts_open_format] Failed to open file \"allsites.vcf.gz\" : No such file or directory\nFailed to read from allsites.vcf.gz: No such file or directory\n\n\nThe header field consists of eight mandatory columns CHROM, POS, ID, REF, ALT, QUAL, FILTER and INFO, followed by FORMAT and sample columns that contain the called genotypes:\n\nbcftools view -h allsites.vcf.gz | grep CHROM\n\n[E::hts_open_format] Failed to open file \"allsites.vcf.gz\" : No such file or directory\nFailed to read from allsites.vcf.gz: No such file or directory\n\n\nLet’s look at the first SNP entry (here, the first line extracts the position of the SNP):\n\npos=$(bcftools view -v snps -s PUN-R-JMC allsites.vcf.gz -H | head -n 1 | cut -f 2)\nbcftools view -v snps -s PUN-R-JMC allsites.vcf.gz LG4:$pos | tail -n 2\n\n[E::hts_open_format] Failed to open file \"allsites.vcf.gz\" : No such file or directory\nFailed to read from allsites.vcf.gz: No such file or directory\n[E::_regions_init_string] Could not parse the region(s): LG4:\nFailed to read the regions: LG4:\n\n\nThe most important columns are CHROM, which indicates the sequence (LG4), the genome position POS, the reference allele REF (i.e., the nucleotide in the reference sequence), and the alternate allele ALT, which is the called variant. QUAL is a Phred-scaled quality of the call and can be used to filter low-quality calls. The FILTER column can be used to set filter flags. The INFO column contains metadata concerning the site; for instance, DP is the approximate read depth, the definition of which is included in the meta-information:\n\nbcftools view -h allsites.vcf.gz | grep INFO | grep \"ID=DP\"\n\n[E::hts_open_format] Failed to open file \"allsites.vcf.gz\" : No such file or directory\nFailed to read from allsites.vcf.gz: No such file or directory\n\n\nFinally, the columns following FORMAT pertain to the samples and contain the genotype calls, formatted according to the - you guessed it - FORMAT column. The example above contains a number of fields, where GT is the genotype:\n\nbcftools view -h allsites.vcf.gz | grep FORMAT | grep \"ID=GT\"\n\n[E::hts_open_format] Failed to open file \"allsites.vcf.gz\" : No such file or directory\nFailed to read from allsites.vcf.gz: No such file or directory\n\n\nFor diploid samples, the genotype format is #/#, or #|# for phased data, where the hash marks are numbers that refer to the reference (0) and alternate (1 or higher) alleles. A . indicates a missing call.\nViewing variants and regions\nThe bcftools view command allows for quick access and viewing of file contents. A prerequisite is that we first index the file:\n\nbcftools index allsites.vcf.gz\n\nafter which we can view, say, the first three indel variants in the region 12,010,000-12,010,100, corresponding to VCF coordinates 10,000-10,1009:\n\nbcftools view -v indels -H allsites.vcf.gz LG4:10000-10100\n\n[E::hts_open_format] Failed to open file \"allsites.vcf.gz\" : No such file or directory\nFailed to read from allsites.vcf.gz: No such file or directory\n\n\nbcftools view has many options for subsetting and filtering variants. Remember to consult the help pages!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How many SNPs are there in region LG4:12010000-12000100?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook in the help page for option -v.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Option -H omits the header information\nbcftools view -H -v snps allsites.vcf.gz LG4:10000-10100\n# Could also use wc -l to count the number of lines\nbcftools view -H -v snps allsites.vcf.gz LG4:10000-10100 | wc -l\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting samples\nFinally, we look at how we can select samples from a variant file. To list the samples in a file, we can run bcftools query:\n\nbcftools query -l allsites.vcf.gz\n\n[E::hts_open_format] Failed to open file \"allsites.vcf.gz\" : No such file or directory\nFailed to read from allsites.vcf.gz: No such file or directory\n\n\nSelecting indel variants for a given sample, say PUN-Y-BCRD, and region LG4:12001000-12001100 can then be done as follows:\n\nbcftools view -H -s PUN-Y-BCRD -v indels allsites.vcf.gz LG4:1000-1100\n\n[E::hts_open_format] Failed to open file \"allsites.vcf.gz\" : No such file or directory\nFailed to read from allsites.vcf.gz: No such file or directory"

It can also be applied to haploid organisms, like bacteria."

In these early days, an allele would refer to variant forms of a gene, observed as differences in phenotypes. Genes, or loci, would be denoted using alphabetic characters, such as \\(A\\), and allelic types could be referenced with indices, e.g., \\(A_1, A_2, ..., A_n\\).\nTo simplify calculations, we often look at one locus and we assume two alleles, whereby we skip the indices and denote the allelic pairs \\(A\\) and \\(a\\) (although note that notations differs from author to author; for instance Gillespie (2004) uses \\(A_1, A_2\\) for bi-allelic loci). For two-locus systems we simply denote the second allele with \\(B, b\\), and so on.\nThe example shows a hypothetical locus having two alleles \\(A\\) and \\(a\\) that have phenotypes red and white flower color, and where heterozygotes are colored pink.

This is the geometric distribution \\(Ge(p)\\), with parameter \\(p=\\frac{1}{2N}\\), and expected value \\(\\frac{1}{p}={2N}\\). That is, the expected number of generations for two sequences to find a common ancestor (i.e., coalesce) is \\(2N\\) generations.\nSince a large fraction of genes lack descendants, very quickly (compared to 2N) a population will descend from a small proportion of genes.\nDerivation of average time to having same parent (i.e., coalescence) requires knowledge of geometric distribution.

At \\(t=0\\) all populations are in state 5/10.\nKimura’s plot is very instructive and students are encouraged to test the recipe code, increasing the number of states incrementally. For large enough N, the histograms can be approximated by continuous distributions. This observation led Kimura (even though diffusion equations were originally introduced to genetics by Fisher in 1922) to apply diffusion theory to obtain probability densities of allele frequencies, leading in turn to compact expressions of fixation probabilities, expected ages of alleles, and more. A treatment of diffusion theory is outside the scope of this course; the interested reader can consult e.g., (Ewens, 2004).\nThe Buri experiment is an empirical demonstration of Kimura’s plot.\nOn the sampling model, (Charlesworth & Charlesworth, 2010, p. 231) says:\n\nIt is, however, impossible to write down a simple algebraic expression for P, even without selection and mutation.

The black-footed ferret population has declined dramatically through the twentieth century due to destruction of their habitat and sylvatic plague. In 1979, when the last known black-footed ferret died in captivity, they were thought to be extinct. In 1981, a very small wild population was rediscovered (40 individuals), but in 1985 this population suffered a number of disease outbreaks. At that point of the 18 remaining wild individuals were brought into captivity, 7 of which reproduced. Thanks to intense captive breeding efforts and conservation work, a wild population of over 300 individuals has been established since. However, because all of these individuals are descended from those 7 individuals who survived the bottleneck, diversity levels remain low. Wisely et al. measured heterozygosity at a number of microsatellites in individuals from museum collections, showing the sharp drop in diversity as population sizes crashed (see Figure 4.5).\n\nSegue: population size important; however, census population size is not always the measure we want when relating to genetic diversity"

Equation relates allele frequency change to viabilities for different genotypes. It is instructive to study the equation and plot trajectories to gain an intuition for how allele frequencies evolve given the different selection regimes.\nThe left panel shows that the three modes of selection have different equilibrium points: for directional selection the favored homozygote will eventually attain 100%, balancing selection has a stable equilibrium point (attractor) for a given allelic ratio (here 25:75), and disruptive selection has an unstable equilibrium point (repeller) for a given allelic ratio.\nThe right panel shows the rate of change as a function of allele frequency. Note how the directionality changes at the equilibrium point for balancing and directional selection."

Mutation could reintroduce variation. Recombination could increase diversity in neighbourhood, but in a manner that depends on the distance from the locus under selection.\n\nAlternatives to direct selection tests are those that look at linked selection. In essence, we look for characteristic patterns in the vicinity of a selected locus. A sweep leads to the selected site and neigbouring sites being monomorphic (and therefore invisible to tests based on direct selection). Without recombination, mutation could reintroduce variation. In the presence of recombination, the effect of reduced diversity will be dependent on distance from the locus under selection.\nNote here that every sequence can be treated as an allele, such that we in essence are looking multi- and not a bi-allelic locus."
