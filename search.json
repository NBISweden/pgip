    "text": "Note\n\n\n\n\nWe assume that the input data has already been filtered and pre-processed to obtain a high-quality variant call set. See .\nsgkit pca method does not support missing data - add example?\n\n\n\nVariant data is high-dimensional and some sort of dimensionality reduction is often employed to provide a condensed overview of the data and as a means to identify potential population structure. Principal component analysis (PCA) is one common technique usually applied to genetic variation data (e.g. (Patterson et al., 2006)).\nFor large data sets, it is common practice to first prune the data to remove correlation between data points. In this exercise, you will prune the data using either plink or sgkit code snippets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIXME\n\n\n\nsgkit is likely too cumbersome? Keep as reference for now, use EIGENSOFT or plink for pruning and pca.\n\n\n\nimport os\nimport sgkit as sg\nfrom sgkit.io import vcf as sgvcf\n\nThen make output directories and convert vcf to the zarr format.\n\noutdir = \"output/ld_pruning\"\nos.makedirs(outdir, exist_ok=True)\nvcf = \"../data/ooa/ooa.gatk.vcf.gz\"\nzarr = os.path.join(outdir, \"ooa.gatk.zarr\")\nsgvcf.vcf_to_zarr(vcf, zarr)\n\nWe load the data and remember the original chunk size (needed internally for sgkit):\n\nds = sg.load_dataset(zarr)\noriginal_chunk_size = ds.chunks[\"variants\"][0]\n\n\n\n\nBefore pruning the data, we make a plot of the LD structure. We will use python for plotting and first load the necessary libraries:\n\n\n\nDepending on the number of variants, it may be necessary to work on a subset of variants. Here with only {python} #| echo: false display(Markdown(\"\"\"{nvar}\"\"\".format(nvar = len(ds.variants)))) variants we skip this step.\nFor pruning, we first need to calculate the dosage:\n\nds['dosage'] = ds['call_genotype'].sum(dim='ploidy')\n\nand then divide into windows by variants:\n\nds = sg.window_by_variant(ds, size=200)\nprint(ds)\n\n<xarray.Dataset>\nDimensions:               (windows: 4, variants: 648, samples: 10, ploidy: 2,\n                           alleles: 4, filters: 2)\nDimensions without coordinates: windows, variants, samples, ploidy, alleles,\n                                filters\nData variables: (12/15)\n    window_contig         (windows) int64 0 0 0 0\n    window_start          (windows) int64 0 200 400 600\n    window_stop           (windows) int64 200 400 600 648\n    call_genotype         (variants, samples, ploidy) int8 dask.array<chunksize=(648, 10, 2), meta=np.ndarray>\n    call_genotype_mask    (variants, samples, ploidy) bool dask.array<chunksize=(648, 10, 2), meta=np.ndarray>\n    call_genotype_phased  (variants, samples) bool dask.array<chunksize=(648, 10), meta=np.ndarray>\n    ...                    ...\n    variant_filter        (variants, filters) bool dask.array<chunksize=(648, 2), meta=np.ndarray>\n    variant_id            (variants) object dask.array<chunksize=(648,), meta=np.ndarray>\n    variant_id_mask       (variants) bool dask.array<chunksize=(648,), meta=np.ndarray>\n    variant_position      (variants) int32 dask.array<chunksize=(648,), meta=np.ndarray>\n    variant_quality       (variants) float32 dask.array<chunksize=(648,), meta=np.ndarray>\n    dosage                (variants, samples) int64 dask.array<chunksize=(648, 10), meta=np.ndarray>\nAttributes:\n    contigs:               ['tsk_6-CEU-3-0']\n    filters:               ['PASS', 'LowQual']\n    max_alt_alleles_seen:  1\n    source:                sgkit-0.5.0\n    vcf_header:            ##fileformat=VCFv4.2\\n##FILTER=<ID=PASS,Descriptio...\n    vcf_zarr_version:      0.1\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore proceeding with the pca, we need to compute quality control variant statistics from genotype calls followed by calculation of and filtering on allele frequencies.\n\n\n\nds = sg.variant_stats(ds)\n\nds = ds.assign(**ds[[\"variant_allele_frequency\"]].compute()).pipe(\nlambda ds: ds.sel(variants=(ds.variant_allele_frequency[:, 1] > 0.01))\n)\nds = ds.chunk(original_chunk_size)\n\nNow we can perform pca.\n\n# Transform genotype call into number of non-reference alleles\nds_pca = sg.stats.pca.count_call_alternate_alleles(ds)\n# Ensure data has positive variance across samples\nvariant_mask = ((ds_pca.call_alternate_allele_count < 0).any(dim=\"samples\")) | (\nds_pca.call_alternate_allele_count.std(dim=\"samples\") <= 0.0\n)\n\nds_pca = ds_pca.sel(variants=~variant_mask)\nds_pca[\"call_alternate_allele_count\"] = ds_pca.call_alternate_allele_count.chunk(\n(None, -1)\n)\nds_pca = sg.pca(ds_pca, n_components=10)\n\nWe convert the data structure to a pandas dataframe and add various metadata, such as sample and population names.\n\nexplained = ds_pca.sample_pca_explained_variance_ratio.values * 100\ndf = (\nds_pca.sample_pca_projection.to_dataframe()\n.reset_index()\n.pivot(index=\"samples\", columns=\"components\")\n)\ndf.index.names = [\"sample\"]\ndf.columns = [f\"PC{i+1}\" for _, i in df.columns]\ndf.reset_index(inplace=True)\ndf[\"sample\"] = ds_pca.sample_id[df[\"sample\"].values].values\ndf[\"population\"] = df[\"sample\"].str.slice(0, 3)\ncolors = dict(zip(set(df[\"population\"]), utils._get_palette(n=3)))\ndf[\"color\"] = [colors[x] for x in df[\"population\"]]\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, we want to also investigate the effect of sequencing coverage.\n\nimport io\nimport pandas as pd\nimport subprocess\noutput = subprocess.check_output(\"samtools depth -a ../data/ooa/*.bam\", shell=True)\ncoverage = pd.read_table(io.StringIO(output.decode()), header=None).mean(axis=0)\ndf[\"coverage\"] = coverage[1:]\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_7821/4118459200.py:5: FutureWarning: The default value of numeric_only in DataFrame.mean is deprecated.

Datasets of type 3 are results that take a long time to compute (e.g. on a HPC) and will be needed to enable compilation of jupyter book examples\nOnly small datasets are committed to this repo. In the case we need larger datasets, setup an independent data repo.\n\n\nDatasets reside in the data subdirectory Table 1 .

Demographic models are defined using the Demes specification. For neutral models, genealogies and mutations are simulated with msprime and saved as succinct tree sequences that can be converted to standard variant call format (vcf) files.\nThe variant data represents the true state of the model. In addition, we can assign haplotypes to each individual from which sequence reads can be simulated. One simulated individual is chosen as reference and a reference sequence is generated, either from experimental data or randomly, for that individual. Given the reference and the variant data, haplotype sequences are generated for each individual in the model. The haplotype sequences are then used as templates to generate sequencing reads with realistic error profiles. Currently insilicoseq is used to simulate reads.\nSimulated reads are mapped with bwa to the reference and saved to bam files. The raw data reads and haplotype sequences are finally discarded to save space. Variant calling is done with GATK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIXME\n\n\n\nDesired improvements:\n\ncurrent datasets are based on randomly generated sequences.

That comes with issues of its own, such as reads primarily mapping to conserved regions, thereby biasing population genomic statistics, or structural rearrangements between species hampering inferences. A final option is to map reads to a reference transcriptome.

    "text": "The nucleotide diversity is defined as the average number of pairwise differences per site for a number of sequences (Nei & Kumar, 2000, p. 251):\n\\[\n\\pi = \\sum_{ij} x_i x_j \\pi_{ij}\n\\]\nHere \\(x_i\\) is the population frequency of sequence \\(i\\). It is unclear whether it means the number of occurrences or the fraction of sequence \\(i\\) in a population of \\(n\\) samples.\nSince \\(\\pi_{ii} = 0\\) and \\(\\pi_{ij} = \\pi_{ji}\\), the equation can be rewritten as\n\\[\n\\pi = \\sum_{ij} x_i x_j \\pi_{ij} = \\sum_{i<j} x_i x_j \\pi_{ij} + \\sum_{j<i} x_j x_i \\pi_{ji} + \\sum_{i} x_i x_i \\pi_{ii} = 2\\sum_{ij} x_i x_j \\pi_{ij}\n\\]\nThe (second) summation has \\(n(n-1)/2\\) terms.\nThe nucleotide diversity can also be expressed as a function of the allele frequency spectrum (afs) \\(p = (p_1,p_2,...,p_q)\\), where \\(p_i\\) is the frequency of sites with \\(i\\) minor alleles, and \\(q\\) is the number of possible non-monomorphic allele configurations. For diploid organisms, \\(q = 2k - 1\\). \\(p\\) is the unfolded afs. There is a folded version \\(p^* = (p^*_1, p^*_2, p^*_{\\lceil(q+1)/2\\rceil})\\), where \\(p^*_i = p_i + p_{q-i}\\) for \\(i \\neq \\lceil(q+1)/2\\rceil\\) and \\(p^*_i = p_i\\) otherwise.\nNow, for a given site \\(s\\) with \\(i\\) minor alleles, there are \\(i(q-i)\\) different combinations where \\(\\pi_{ij} \\neq 0\\). Moreover, \\(x_i = x_j =  1\\), such that\n\\[\n\\pi_s = \\sum_{i<j} x_i x_j \\pi_{ij} = i(q - i)\n\\]\nGeneralizing to \\(S = \\sum_{i=1}^{q} p_i\\) sites, there are \\(p_i\\) sites with allele configuration \\(i, (q-i)\\), such that\n\\[\n\\pi = \\sum_{i=1}^{q} p_i i (q-i)\n\\]\nNormalizing by the number of terms for each site, \\(n(n-1)/2\\) gives the average pairwise nucleotide diversity per site.\nLetting \\(k = \\lceil(q+1)/2\\rceil\\), we can further rewrite \\(\\pi\\) as\n\\[\n\\pi = \\sum_{i=1}^{q} p_i i (q-i) = p_k k (q-k) +  \\sum_{i=1}^{k - 1} p_i i (q-i) + p_{q-i} (q-i) i = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p^*_i i (k - i)\n\\]"

    "text": "As the focus of the course is on hands-on work, the topics have been designed to cover the fundamental analyses that are common in many population genomics studies. The course consists of lectures and exercises, with a focus on the practical aspects of analyses. Whereas lectures introduce some background theory, their primary aim is to set the stage for accompanying exercises.\n\n\nIn principle, you could imagine the course structure to follow that of a manuscript (Fuller et al., 2020)\nHigh-throughput DNA sequencing has now made it possible to generate whole-genome resequencing data for multiple individuals and populations, and a first step is to map sequence data to a reference, perform variant calling and variant filtering.\nOnce a high-quality variant set has been obtained, a common task is to describe variation, either in terms of summary statistics such as nucleotide diversity (\\(\\pi\\)) or site-frequency spectra (sfs), or as descriptions of population structure in terms of admixture or pca plots.\nGenetic diversity is also affected by population history and demographic processes such as population expansion, bottlenecks, migration events and hybridizations.\nFinally, it is often of interest to identify adaptive traits, to which end selection tests and scans can be performed. The tests are designed to detect signals of selection, either via direct selection on loci, or by looking at haplotype structures to detect linked selection.\n\n\n\nMuch of what has been described in The manuscript route has recently been treated in an article on recommendations for improving statistical inference in population genomics (Johri et al., 2022). In it, the authors point out that whereas historically theoretical advances outpaced data production, that is no longer true due to the advent of next-generation sequencing. In particular, they caution researchers to attach too much faith to a test that explains the data well, as there are many alternative hypotheses with equal explanatory power, but with drastically different conclusions. At the very least, a population genomics study should aim at first generating a baseline model consisting of all or several of the following components:\n\nmutation\nrecombination\nreassortment\ngene conversion\npurifying selection acting on functional regions and its effects on linked variants (background selection)\ngenetic drift with demographic history and geographic structure\n\nThe exercises are designed to address many of the points above, and to highlight cases where competing hypotheses may actually explain data to equal degrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIXME\n\n\n\nRewrite/restructure and add more additional topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNB: with time we could use repo to collect all kinds of exercises (even those that don’t fit current curriculum), providing the possibility to create optional course plans\n\n\nA five day course cannot but provide an overview of possible analyses and topics. Among the things we won’t have time to cover are\n\nmachine learning and AI for population genomics\nrecombination landscape estimation\ngene conversion\nexperimental design\ncoalescent and Wright-Fisher simulations\nABC methods\nancestral recombination graphs and tree sequence inference\nancient DNA\nspatial genetics\n…\n\n\n\n\nmachine learning and AI for population genomics\nsimulation (focus on msprime and SLiM)\nancestral recombination graphs and tree sequence inference"
